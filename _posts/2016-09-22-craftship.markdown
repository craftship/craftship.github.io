So over the past few months we have been getting settled in a new office based
just of the Old St. roundabout at WeWork.  WeWork is a community of a variety
of start-ups and companies in an awesome co-located office.

To kick of our new blog we thought it best to give a tour of our working
enviornment with a few photos.

The entrance, do what you love everyday.

Craftship desk space with huge sky light to let light in during the
summer and desk lamps for those cosy winter months.

Regular events and activities usually go on every week and we hope to be
speaking at some events in the near future to give everyone an idea of
what services we can offer.

So if you are ever about fancy a beer or coffee on us, feel free to pop down and
say hello!
