So over the past weeks I have been getting set up in a new office based
just of the Old St. roundabout at WeWork.

WeWork is a community of like minded companies / people in an awesome
co-located office.  Thankfully there is plenty of free beer and coffee
on tap and available to keep you going throughout the week.

Regular events and activities usually go on every week and I hope to be
speaking at some events in the near future to give everyone an idea of
what services we can offer.

So if you are about and ever fancy a beer, feel free to pop down or get
in touch.
